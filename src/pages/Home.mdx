# The Garden 🏡

## Where am I?

Hey there! Welcome to my data structures & algorithm garden 🏡

I'm Michael Dinerstein
([@missionmikedev](https://www.twitter.com/missionmikedev) on Twitter), a
developer and designer always eager to learn more.

## Learning is Infinite ♾️

Regardless how many years of experience I have, how many projects I've built, or
how "successful" I've been, there will _always_ room to improve.

Similar to how [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)
applies to transistors, it's reasonable to expect that a similar law accounts
for the regular increase in available software libraries, frameworks, and new
invention. As such, it's important to remember that **it's impossible to know it
all, ever.** While I'm learning one subject, _countless_ new things are being
invented.

Here I'll be studying concepts new to me, sharing my studies and growing
publicly.

Check the nav menu to explore. Cheers!
